\chapter{Profile of the Organization}
Every chapter should start with an introduction paragraph. This paragraph should brief about the flow of the chapter. This introduction can be limited within 4 to 5 sentences. The chapter heading should be appropriately modified (a sample heading is shown for this chapter). But don't start the introduction paragraph in the chapters like "This chapter deals with....".
