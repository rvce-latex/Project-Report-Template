\chapter{Reflections}
Self-Assessment and Learning Outcomes: This chapter focuses on the personal and professional growth of the student. It is a qualitative look at how the internship transformed their skills.

\section{Technical Knowledge Acquired} 
List the specific technical competencies gained. This could include proficiency in a new programming language (e.g., Python, Verilog), mastery of simulation tools (e.g., MATLAB, Cadence), or understanding of industry-standard protocols (e.g., I2C, SPI). Mention how this bridges the gap between your college curriculum and industry requirements.

\section{Soft Skills Acquired}
Reflect on the non-technical skills developed during the tenure. Discuss improvements in professional communication, time management, teamwork within a corporate hierarchy, and the ability to work under real-world deadlines. Mention any experience gained in documentation and presentation during team meetings.
