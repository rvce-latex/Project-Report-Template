\textbf{Guidelines for Students:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Keep it to one page: The summary should be concise and take up no more than one side of a sheet.

	\item No Citations: Do not use references or citations in the executive summary.
	\item Tense: Write it in the past tense since it describes a completed experience.
\end{itemize}
