\chapter{Design of Pipelined Analog to Digital converter}

\indent\indent From Chapter 2 onwards, every chapter should start with an introduction paragraph. This paragraph should brief about the flow of the chapter. This introduction can be limited within 4 to 5 sentences. The chapter heading should be appropriately modified (a sample heading is shown for this chapter).But don't start the introduction paragraph in the chapters 2 to end with "This chapter deals with....". Instead you should bring in the highlights of the chapter in the introduction paragraph. 
\section{Contents of this Chapter}
This chapter should contain the following sections and subsections in detail.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Specifications for the Design
\item Pre analysis work for the design or Models used
\item Design methodology in detail
\item Design Equations
\item Experimental techniques (if any)
\end{enumerate}
Apart from the aforementioned sections, you can add sections as per the requirements of the project in consultation with your guide.

\section{Paraphrasing}
When you paraphrase a written passage, you rewrite it to state the essential ideas in your own words. Because you do not quote your source word for word when paraphrasing, it is unnecessary to enclose the paraphrased material in quotation marks. However, the paraphrased material must be properly referenced because the ideas are taken from someone else whether or not the words are identical. 

Ordinarily, the majority of the notes you take during the research phase of writing your report will paraphrase the original material. Paraphrase only the essential ideas. Strive to put original ideas into your own words without distorting them."

\section{Quotations}
When you have borrowed words, facts, or idea of any kind from someone else's work, acknowledge your debt by giving your source credit in footnote (or in running text as cited reference). Otherwise, you will be guilty of plagiarism. Also, be sure you have represented the original material honestly and accurately. Direct word to word quotations are enclosed in quotation marks."

 \textbf{The chapters should not end with figures, instead bring the paragraph explaining about the figure at the end followed by a summary paragraph.}

After elaborating the various sections of the chapter (From Chapter 2 onwards), a summary paragraph should be written discussing the highlights of that particular chapter. This summary paragraph should not be numbered separately. This paragraph should connect the present chapter to the next chapter.
